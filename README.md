# Gaming during Lockdown

We study changes in gaming behavior during COVID-19 using data from Steam.

## Analyses and reproducibility

The data analyses are organized into separate [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) files for processing, describing, and modelling.

The project is organized as a R [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) project, so you can reproduce all analyses by building the book (e.g. in RStudio click the "Build Book" button). The results are rendered to `docs/index.html` and can be viewed in a web browser.

## Raw data

Is in data-raw/ which can't yet be pushed online.
